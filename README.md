css-flow
========

CSS normal flow is often misunderstood and leads to a heck lot of junk in our code. Did you already applied different `position` or `display` to a given selector until you get one that works?

If the answer is yes, I invite you to read the rest of this article. 

## overview

So what is normal flow anyway? It is basically the way your elements will be rendered and will flow down a document if not [positionned](http://github.com/owietrich/css-positions).

Normal flow is part of the [basic box model](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-box/) described in the HTML specificiations. You'll need to know at least 4 types of rendering box used for an element in order to master it:

  - block
  - inline
  - inline-block
  - none

## block

## inline

## inline-block
